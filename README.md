Performed Cleaning of Data,
Then I have performed transforming the data,
I analyzed it and performed a visualization.
Then I predicted the analysis using various charts in Power BI.
I have used DAX for various operations on data.

Conclusion:
My analysis revealed some noteworthy statistics for the months of April, May, and June 2022. In April, we observed an impressive 94% attendance rate, with 9.1% of employees working from home. May witnessed 89.7% attendance, along with 11.2% of individuals opting for remote work. June showcased a remarkable 91.5% attendance, with 9.5% of the workforce working from home.
My involvement in this project began with a thorough analysis of the client's requirements, ensuring a deep understanding of the provided data. To facilitate this, I engaged with stakeholders, posing relevant questions to gain valuable insights.
When it came to data management, I chose Power BI over Excel for its efficiency. Employing Power Query, I seamlessly imported and transformed the data, meticulously removing any errors. To further enhance data processing, I created a specialized function tailored to the original dataset. The dashboard itself was brought to life through the application of DAX functions, offering a comprehensive and visually appealing snapshot of the data.
Analyzing data has always been a passion of mine.

The ability to derive meaningful insights and translate them into actionable strategies is a valuable asset in today's data-driven landscape.
